<h3>pico</h3>
Microbiome data are compositional in nature, conveying only relative information about the taxa detected and precluding statistical inference. Despite these limitations, marker gene surveys are frequently treated as discrete measurements existing in Cartesian space. Here, I introduce pico, an L1 penalized transformation that converts compositional microbiome data into Cartesian coordinates 'balanced' by highly informative ratios of bacterial taxa. These ratios, termed 'balances', are used to construct an orthonormal basis within Cartesian space to evaluate hypotheses in a robust and statistically valid way. In the associated manuscript, we employ pico to reveal shifts in the composition of fecal microbiota associated with altered vaccine response in a longitudinal cohort of HIV-exposed and unexposed Nigerian infants. We demonstrate that pico correctly identifies discriminant taxa across mock datasets and outperforms several common transformations and distance metrics across multiple publicly available datasets. We fit penalized regression models to identify balances that discriminate fecal communities of HIV-exposed versus unexposed infants in responders versus nonresponders to OPV. Within the first week, we report a significantly increased abundance of Collinsella and Lactobacillus, and a decreased abundance of Streptococcus and Rhodococcus in exposed versus unexposed infants that predicts vaccine responsiveness. pico enables robust analysis and modeling of compositional microbiome data. Our data reveal shifts in the composition of infant fecal microbiota that are highly predictive of HIV exposure and germane to clinical outcomes.
