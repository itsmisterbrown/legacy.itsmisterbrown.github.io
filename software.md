<b>Background:</b> Microbiome data are compositional in nature, conveying only relative information about the taxa detected and precluding statistical inference. Despite these limitations, marker gene surveys are frequently treated as discrete measurements existing in Cartesian space. Here, we introduce pico, an L1 penalized transformation that converts and decomposes  compositional microbiome data into a Cartesian coordinate system with reduced dimensionality 'balanced' by highly informative ratios of bacterial taxa. These ratios, termed 'balances', are used to construct an orthonormal basis within Cartesian space to evaluate hypotheses in a robust and statistically valid way. We employ pico to reveal shifts in the composition of fecal microbiota associated with altered vaccine response in a longitudinal cohort of HIV-exposed and unexposed Nigerian infants.
<b>Methods:</b> pico consists of three steps. First, we perform a centered log ratio (CLR) transformation across the dataset. The CLR is a transformation that centers compositional parts (counts of bacterial sequences) to the geometric mean of sample. Second, we identify orthonormal balances by applying an L1 Penalized Matrix Decomposition on the CLR transformed data. Third, we transform the dataset to Cartesian coordinates by balancing the transformation with the balances of taxa identified in step 2.
<b>Results:</b>We demonstrate that pico correctly identifies discriminant taxa across mock datasets and outperforms several common transformations and distance metrics across multiple publicly available datasets. We fit penalized regression models to identify balances that significantly discriminate fecal communities of HIV-exposed infants with altered response to oral polio vaccine. Within the first week, we report a significantly increased abundance of Collinsella and Lactobacillus, and a decreased abundance of Streptococcus and Rhodococcus in exposed versus unexposed infants that predicts vaccine responsiveness. Furthermore, we identify strains of Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Propionibacterium present in the infant gut shortly after birth that are linear predictors of serum titer responses to OPV across the first 36 weeks of life. 
<b>Conclusions:</b> pico enables robust analysis and modeling of compositional microbiome data. Our data reveal shifts in the composition of infant fecal microbiota that are highly predictive of HIV exposure and germane to clinical outcomes.
